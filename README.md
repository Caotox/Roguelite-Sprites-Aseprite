## To see the sprites, there are 2 possibilities
# 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Caotox/Roguelite-Sprites-Aseprite/new/main?filename=README.md
```
# 2.1 - If you don't have Aseprite 
Open the .png files, no pixel Art modification possibilities then.

# 2.2 - If you have Aseprite
Open the .aseprite files, which you can then visualize or modify, depending on what you want to do.
